# TermMath
This is my first project, this is a calculator that performs binary conversion and reverse operation in addition to basic operations. Reports factorial and more. This program is incomplete, it did not work correctly until 0.03 verbs so I will offer you this verbs directly. I know not many will use it because there is a better alternative, but I will develop it.

incruction: 

git clone https://github.com/Whoami304/TermMath

cd TermMath

g++ main.cpp

./a.out
